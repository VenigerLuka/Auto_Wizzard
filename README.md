# Auto_Wizzard
 Auto Wizzard is an app inspired by Ninite.com written by VenigerLuka.
 A lot of GUI is self generated but there is also self written GUI elements
 such as the Admin UI. My code is messy due to learning PyQt5 and doing
 the final project in a short time. I will continue to work on this app
 because this is my first real project in Python3 and I will just upgrade
 my app as I learn new things.
 
 Requiered libraries for pip install are in the requirements.txt
 command: pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt
 after run cmd as elevated user(admin) and navigate to path/to/Auto_Wizzard
 and run command: python AuttoWizzard.py
 
 Admin login inside the app:
	Username: root
	Password: toor

 Thank you for using Auto Wizzard.
